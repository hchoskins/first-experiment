My Name is Holly. I am a wife and soon to be mother from Salt Lake City, UT. I graduated with a business degree in Recreation Management from Brigham Young University. Currently I am working for an aquatics company called Kapitol Reef. I love to dance, be outdoors, and be with my family. Soon we'll see if I love to code too!
